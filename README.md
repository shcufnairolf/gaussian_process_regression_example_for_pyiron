# Gaussian process regression example for pyiron

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook `workflow.ipynb` which demonstrated a workflow to run a Gaussian process regression on some simple training data. The workflow is implemented using pyiron. The corresponding pyiron class can be found in `gaussian_progress_regression.py`. These files have been developed within the BMBF-funded project DiMoGraph.
