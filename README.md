# Gaussian process regression example for pyiron

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook `workflow.ipynb` which demonstrates a workflow to run a Gaussian process regression on some simple training data. The workflow is implemented using pyiron. The corresponding pyiron class can be found in `gaussian_progress_regression.py`. This workflow has been developed within the BMBF-funded project DiMoGraph (Digital models for graphene-based conductor materials, 13XP5190B).
